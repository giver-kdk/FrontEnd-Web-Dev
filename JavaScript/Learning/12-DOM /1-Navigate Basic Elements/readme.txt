NOTE: 
While working with DOM(Document Object Model), it is recommended to 
use web browser's console to display output. Code Editor's terminal would not support 
to display HTML elements as output. 

Steps to see output in web browser:
- Create HTML file and JS file
- Link the JS file in HTML file
- Go Live ( Open ) on HTML file
